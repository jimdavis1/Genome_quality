Genome Quality Assessment Tools 

Please refer to the uploaded readme.doc file and the -h help menu options for the programs.

The files in this repo include:
1. get_core_pgfs.pl:  This is the program for computing the directory of core PGFs
2. core_PGF_genome_quality.pl:  This is the program for computing quality statistics on a new genome
3. Genus_Core_PGFs:  This is the latest build of core PGFs built using "get_core_pgfs.pl" reading from
                     /vol/patric3/fams/2017-0701/merge1/prop.out/merged.families.1.1
4. 2-13.bad.all  This is a file of bad genomes that I made a while back that are too be avoided when building core PGFs
